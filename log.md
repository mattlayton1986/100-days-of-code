# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started a TicTacToe web app, layed out HTML and CSS, very basic Javascript structure.

**Thoughts**: I feel excited to be starting a dedicated project that will hopefully challenge me to learn new concepts and also to learn how to _research_ when I encounter problems.

### Day 2: October 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Converted my TicTacToe Javascript from a top-down code logic into separate objects for `game`, `user`, and `computer`. Experimented with writing objects with both object literal and object constructor styles, and settled for object literal constructors.

**Thoughts**: I like the modularity of having my objects written with object literal constructors,because it makes the code easier to read and keep track of.

### Day 3: October 10, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck on my `user.userClick()` method--no matter what I tried, I couldn't get its functionality to work properly. Thought through the game logic up to that point (with the help of Firefox debugger) and did some research on Javascript/jQuery closures and scope to try to wrap my head around a solution.

**Thoughts**: Extremely frustrated that my code feels like a solid wall of non-functionality. When walking through the code step by step I see no reason why it shouldn't work. Research and stepping away from the problem seem to be increasing the frustration I'm feeling.

### Day 4: October 11, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Still stuck on my non-functioning `user.userClick()` function. Went to a 'Anyone Can Learn to Code--Chicago' meetup for an introduction to Ruby on Rails, where we created a _very_ basic Rails site via cloud9. Gave my TicTacToe app some thought and research; attempted to solve the problem by researching other Stack Overflow questions and [posting a question of my own](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39990031/javascript-event-handler-this-binding-inside-closure-not-working/39990276?noredirect=1#comment67260129_39990276). 

**Thoughts**: Feel a little better about diving into Ruby/Rails once I get decently solid with Javascript. Felt frustrated with the quality of answers I got in response to my SO question for my app and the (perhaps perceived) condescension of more experienced programmers in response to newbie questions on SO.

### Day 5: October 12, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the responses I received to my SO question and tweaked my `user.userClick()` method around a bit until I hit a breakthrough and _finally_ managed to get it working how I wanted.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited that I managed to break past a big brick wall in my code, even though it took me several days of research, debugging, and thought. Its an incredible feeling to wrestle with something and ultimately see it work (even unexpectedly). Note to self: grow thicker skin re: computer's constant and brutal rejection.
